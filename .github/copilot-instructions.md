# Mnemocyte Smart NPCs Application

This workspace contains the Mnemocyte Smart NPCs application - an AI-powered system for creating intelligent video game characters with emotions, actions, roles, and routines. The project uses FOXP2 references throughout the codebase to represent the neural memory systems.

## Project Overview
- **Character Creator**: Interface for designing NPCs with custom attributes
- **Interactive Playground**: Environment for testing and interacting with individual NPCs
- **Game Environment**: Multi-character playground supporting up to 10 parallel NPCs
- **AI Integration**: Advanced behavioral systems with contextual responses

## UI Design
- **Minecraft-style Interface**: Pixelated, blocky aesthetic with Minecraft-inspired fonts and UI elements
- **Retro Gaming Feel**: Chunky buttons, pixel-perfect borders, and classic game interface patterns
- **Responsive Design**: Maintains Minecraft aesthetic across all screen sizes

## Architecture
- Frontend: Next.js with React and TypeScript for character creator and playground interfaces
- Backend: Next.js API routes for character management and AI integration
- AI Services: Integration with language models for intelligent NPC behaviors
- Real-time: WebSocket support for live character interactions
- UI Framework: Tailwind CSS with custom Minecraft-style components

## Key Components
- Character creation and customization system
- Emotion and mood tracking
- Action and routine management
- Role-based behavior patterns
- Real-time interaction engine
- Multi-character coordination system

## Development Guidelines
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Implement modular character behavior systems
- Ensure responsive design for all interfaces
- Maintain clean separation between character logic and presentation
- Follow React best practices for component architecture
